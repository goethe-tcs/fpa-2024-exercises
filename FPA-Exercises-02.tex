\begin{exercise}[Independent set in regular graphs] %Trivial FPT: \itshape I can design FPT algorithms by observing that the optimal solution must be large][\mandatory]
  Recall that the independent set problem asks whether a given graph contains a clique of size at least~$k$.
  Let $r$ be a constant positive integer.
  Show that the independent set problem, when parameterized by~$k$, is fixed-parameter tractable on $r$-regular graphs.
  \emph{Bonus:} Show that this remains true if~$r$ is part of the input and we parameterize by~$k+r$.
\end{exercise}

  \begin{exercise}[Clique in regular graphs][\mandatory]\label{clique}
    Recall that the clique problem asks whether a given graph contains a clique of size at least~$k$.
    Let~$r$ be a constant positive integer.
    Show that the clique problem, when parameterized by~$k$, is fixed-parameter tractable on $r$-regular graphs.
    \emph{Bonus:} Show that this remains true if~$r$ is part of the input and we parameterize by~$k+r$.
  \end{exercise}
  
  \textbf{Note:} On the surface, the following problem looks very similar to \ref{clique}. However, as you will see, the solution is quite different.

  \begin{exercise}[Vertex-cover in degree two][easy]
  Prove: The vertex-cover problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time on graphs of maximum degree at most $2$.
  \end{exercise}
  
  \begin{exercise}[Bounded search trees for feedback vertex set]
  Show that every graph on $n$ vertices of minimum degree at least $3$ contains a cycle of length at most $2\lceil \log n\rceil$.
  Use this to design a $(\log n)^{O(k)} \cdot  n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for the feedback vertex set problem on undirected graphs.
  Does this runtime bound satisfy the conditions for an fpt-algorithm, that is, can it be bounded by $f(k) \cdot n^{O(1)}$ for some computable $f$?
  \end{exercise}
  
  \begin{exercise}[\hard]
  A graph is \emph{chordal} if it does not contain a cycle on at least four vertices as an induced subgraph.
  That is, for every cycle of length at least four, 
  there is at least one edge in the graph between two vertices of the cycle that is not in the cycle. 
  Such an edge is a \emph{chord}. Hence the name.
  
  A \emph{triangulation} of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of edges $E' \subseteq \binom{V}{2}$ such that $(V,E\cup E')$ is chordal.
  
  Consider the chordal completion problem: Given a graph and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ has a triangulation of size at most $k$. 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Give a $k^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for the problem.
  \item Show that there is a bijection between inclusion-wise minimal triangulations of a cycle of length $\ell$ and binary trees with $\ell-2$ internal nodes. From this, conclude that a cycle on $\ell$ vertices has at most $4^{\ell-2}$ inclusion-wise minimal triangulations.
  \item Use the previous point to design an algorithm for the problem running in time $2^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{exercise}
  
  \begin{exercise}[\hard]
  Consider the following problem: Given a connected graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether there is a spanning tree of $G$ with at least $k$ leaves. Design an algorithm that solves this problem in time $4^k \cdot n^{O(1)}$.
  \end{exercise}
