%   %[\easy]
%   $\textsc{Shortest Path}$ can be solved in time $O(m\cdot \log n)$ by Dijkstra's Algorithm on connected graphs without negative edge-weights. It can be solved in time $O(m \cdot n)$ by the Bellmann-Ford-Algorithm on connected graphs that may contain negative edge-weights. Show that it can be solved in time $O(m\cdot \operatorname{poly}(k,\log n))$ where $k$ is the number of edges with negative weights. Recall that the algorithm must either compute the length of a shortest path from a given node $s$ to a given node $t$ or correctly report the existence of a negative-weight cycle.
