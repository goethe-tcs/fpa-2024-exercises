% \begin{skill}[OVH][\mandatory]
%   I can use the orthogonal vectors hypothesis (OVH) to prove conditional lower bounds for polynomial-time problems.
% \end{skill}

\begin{exercise}[OR has high degree][\mandatory]
  Show that representing the OR of $n$ variables $x_1,\dots,x_n$ exactly with a polynomial over GF$(q)$ where $q$ is prime requires degree exactly $n$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[Probabilistic polynomials for bounded-depth circuits][\mandatory]
  Let $d$ be a positive integer and let $\delta>0$.
  Show that there exists a constant $D>0$ such that, for every $n$ and every depth-$d$ Boolean circuit with $n$ input variables, there exists a probabilistic polynomial $p$ of degree at most~$D$ that satisfies the following for every $x\in\{0,1\}^n$:
  \[
    \Pr_p[C(x)\neq p(x)]\leq\delta\,.
  \]
  \hint{Interatively convert the gates from the bottom up, with lower gates having a smaller error probability.}
\end{exercise}
